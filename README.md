# Rhythm-in-space

A space shooter with very simple controls, you only use mouse to move, the game does everything else. The idea is to combine music and game to create a new experience of gaming. If you like the game, tell me what you like, if you don't like it, tell me what you don't like, I appreciate the feedback. I did the coding as well as drew the sprites used for the game
